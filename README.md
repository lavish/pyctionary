Pyctionary
==========
A word game for geeks.

Pyctionary is a ncurses-based clone of the [Pictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictionary) game. This program enables players to focus on drawing/guessing, automating the game board management. It supports 2-4 teams and cards in csv format. Italian cards are shipped by default as an example.
